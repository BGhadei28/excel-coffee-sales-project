# excel-coffee-sales-project
This project showcases a comprehensive coffee sales dashboard built entirely in Excel using a custom dataset (Jan 2019 â€“ Dec 2022). It features advanced Excel functions like INDEX-MATCH, data cleaning techniques, and interactive elements such as slicers and pivot charts. Users can filter data by loyalty card usage, package weight, roast type, and time. The dashboard includes key visuals such as sales by country, top five customers, and a line graph comparing sales trends across four coffee types.
